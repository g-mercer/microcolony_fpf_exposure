Follow the Zuur process.

Start with sucrose as I think it will be slightly easier. Visualisations.

First determine the random effects component. Use beyond optimal model:

Certainly an increase in variance with day. Potentially a batch*treatment (overall) variance component too. fpf-pure3 has much less variation than control2 for example. Maybe even allowing the degree of variation increase with day to change depending on treatment batch combination. 

Not interested in the effect of microcolony so should include this as a random effect. How to structure it? Compound symmetry where correlation for all observations within microcolony is the same or auto-regressive (or something else as unequal spacings) where correlation between observations depends on time gap between them? 

Can't fit a cubic regression spline smoother as not enough time (day) points. Back to the old quadratic. Centre the quadratic to reduce the collinearity. This causes an apparent discrepancy between the summary output and graphs until you think about it. When day = 0 the cday2 term = 0-37.21186xparameter estimate. 

```{r}
# beyond optimal model.

# biologically this is my beyond optimal model. I can imagine both treatment and batch potentially affecting the 
# starting (intercept) consumption and the relationship between consumption and day. 

# centre day squared
sucrose$cday2 <- sucrose$day^2 - mean(sucrose$day^2)

M.lm <- lm(corrected_consumption ~ day + cday2 + treatment + batch + treatment:batch + treatment:day + treatment:cday2 + batch:day + batch:cday2, data = sucrose)

summary(M.lm)

# use the residuals from this beyond optimal model
plot(M.lm, which = c (1))
```

Clear violation of heterogeneity. Let's start by determining our optimal random effects structure. 

```{r}
library(nlme)

M1.gls <- gls(corrected_consumption ~ day + cday2 + treatment + 
                batch + treatment:batch + treatment:day + 
                treatment:cday2 + batch:day + batch:cday2, 
              data = sucrose, method = "REML")

E <- resid(M1.gls)

op <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

boxplot(E ~ sucrose$treatment, main = "Treatment")
abline(0, 0)

boxplot(E ~ sucrose$batch, main = "Batch")
abline(0, 0)

boxplot(E ~ sucrose$treatment * sucrose$batch, main = "Treatment & Batch")
abline(0, 0)

boxplot(E ~ sucrose$microcolony_number, main = "Microcolony")
abline(0, 0)

par(op)

plot(E ~ sucrose$day, main = "Day")
abline(0, 0)
```

Microcolony clearly needs to be included as an explanatory variable. Treatment * Batch shows some heterogeneity. Also heterogeneity increases with day and it looks like it might differ by treatmentxbatch combination. Apply and test random intercept first. Also, day:microcolony interaction, which suggests a random intercept and slope model may be more appropriate. 

```{r}
# random intercept?
M1.lme <- lme(corrected_consumption ~ day + cday2 + treatment + batch + 
                treatment:batch + treatment:day + treatment:cday2 +

# no
```

The optimal random effects structure is a random intercept and slope (1 + day + cday2 | microcolony) with a variance structure that allows for an increase in variance with day and a difference in variance between treatmentxbatch level (varPower(form =~ day)).

The intercept is highly negatively correlated with day. So if the slope of day increases the intercept decreases. A trick to counteract this is to centre the day. Then again, I am not really interested in the intercept of factors but their interaction with day. Was consumption different over the course of the experiment, not at day 0 where consumption was unspiked sucrose. Also, centering the quadratic term didn't seem to do much.

It's clear that I require additive modelling. mgcv is not possible with cubic regression splines but explore LOWESS (LOESS function), with gam function.
